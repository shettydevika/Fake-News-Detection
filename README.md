# Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on identifying and classifying fake news articles using machine learning techniques. The system analyzes textual content to determine the credibility of news, helping users distinguish between authentic and fake news.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization using NLP techniques.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of supervised learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for performance evaluation.
- **Dataset**: Publicly available dataset for fake news detection from Kaggle.
- **Scalable Pipeline**: Modular design for easy integration and model enhancement.

## Dataset
We used the **Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning** dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle. It contains labeled news articles categorized as real or fake.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, and Matplotlib
- **Visualization**: Confusion Matrix, ROC Curves, and Accuracy Plots
- **Deployment**: Flask or Streamlit for building a web-based interface (optional)

## Use Cases
- Media outlets for content verification.
- Social media platforms to flag fake news.
- Educational institutions for research purposes.

## Future Scope
- Integration with deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs, BERT).
- Real-time fake news detection.
- Multi-lingual support for global news content.
